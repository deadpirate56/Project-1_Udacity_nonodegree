## Analyzing Wallmart Sales

### Project Motivation
 We have sales data from a supermarket company by year and city. This could tell us a lot about the best cities to open a supermatrket, if there are any trends that we should look out for and more. There are some specific questions that we will try to answer given the data
 
1. Which city has the best sales for a supermarket store?
2. Which city has the best footfall for a supermarket store?
3. How does footfall affect sales?
4. Are the sales cyclic/seasonal in nature?

## Files in the repository
README.md - File defining the business problem and approach used to solve it
"Supermarket_sales_trends.ipynb" - Attached is a colab notebook with all the data gathering, cleansing and analysis to answer the final questions

## Summary of results
Some key understandings coming out of the project -
1. Tier 1 cities have the highest footfall and sales
2. Footfall is a good predictor for sales of a supermarket store
3. Sales and footfall are cyclic/seasonal in nature
