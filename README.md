## Analyzing Wallmart Sales

### Project Motivation
 We have sales data from a supermarket company by year and city. This could tell us a lot about the best cities to open a supermatrket, if there are any trends that we should look out for and more. There are some specific questions that we will try to answer given the data
 
 1. Sorting the cities by best to worst sales also which city has best sales?
 2. Is the footfall (the number of people setting foot in the market) seasonal in it's nature?
 3. Do we wee any trends in sales by time?
