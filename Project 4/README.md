## Conclusion
We used the sequential data aligned with mRNA molecules to build models which could predict parameters of paramount importance when it comes to understand their degradation. This was a great experience to work on a real time problem and knowing how I can make a difference using the skills I have. 

## Acknowledgements
I'd like to acknowledge Udacity for the project idea and workspace. A big tanks to the Kaggle community to come up with this competition and all the data science community for their great work on this
